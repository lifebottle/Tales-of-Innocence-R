1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,200
Wait a minute!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,500
Then then...

3
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,000
What about plan C?

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,699
Uhh... what happened to plan B again?	

5
00:00:09,699 --> 00:00:12,000
Ah well, whatever.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Now, now, this should be fine first, right?

7
00:00:18,299 --> 00:00:23,200
Before you attack me, I’m gonna let
you in on some classified information.

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,500
And you all will change your minds.

9
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,500
Just like a mountain’s weather!

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Illia, Ricardo. Got your bullets ready?

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,799
Locked and loaded.

12
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:38,000
Naturally!

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Don’t shoot at someone defenseless!

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,299
Wait, hear me out!!

15
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:51,000
I’ll spill the beans now! Okay?

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Now, boy? 

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,700
Lend me your ear for a bit.
I’ll pay you back later.

18
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,000
Huh? Me?

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Ruca!

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Don’t listen to this guy!

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Now, now, boy.
Listen closely...

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,300
This is the sound of a blade tearing through flesh...

23
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,000
Crap!!

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
YOU BASTARD!!

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Ruca, hang in there!!
