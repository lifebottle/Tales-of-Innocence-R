00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
Asura!  You bastard!!

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:09,000
You’ve killed another one of my comrades!

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:15,199
I won’t forgive you... I won’t forgive you!!

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,799
Stay back, Ruca!

5
00:00:17,799 --> 00:00:21,000
Rest thine heart unto thy blade
to become a shield for others!

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,250
It’s something my gramps used to say to me.

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,500
Get back so you don’t get hurt.

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,000
Here I go!!

8
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,200
...Durandal!
