1
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:05,740
I had a dream

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:07,600
In a faraway place

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:10,100
In a faraway land

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,900
There, I--

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,200
Why am I in this world!

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,000
Right now, at this time, at this place!

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Why was I born!?

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,500
And what meaning does that reason hold!?

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,000
The answer to that lies in this battle!!

10
00:00:31,299 --> 00:00:33,599
For the unification of Cielo!

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
From this day forth, we are no longer rebels.
All of Cielo and future generations

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Will undoubtedly know us as Sensus!

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,799
And soon, we shall obtain the Genesis
the Primordial Wish!

14
00:00:57,799 --> 00:01:00,799
And grant us our ideal world!

15
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:04,000
ALL TROOPS! CHARGE!

16
00:01:32,199 --> 00:01:34,500
Asura, take care...

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,500
Lord Asura...

18
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,199
Lady Inanna, Lady Sakuya.

19
00:01:40,199 --> 00:01:45,500
If it’s Lord Asura, then he will surely
do a splendid job conquering that fortress.

20
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,199
Hahahaha!!

21
00:01:52,199 --> 00:01:57,500
Dear mother! 
The battle will grow stale lest you hold back！

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
If you’ve grown bored,
Then how about I entertain you for the moment?

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
However it will cost you your life!

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Reaper Hypnos... is that what they call you?

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I take it your older brother is in good health?

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,500
Do not mention my brother...
Be quiet and let me slay your life.

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,500
Have you grown tired of stealing souls from
Terro that you’ve come to steal mine instead?

28
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,000
I’m surprised you were able to break
through the barrier laid by the Senate.

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
As expected of the Rebels’ commander.

30
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,500
"Rebel" you say...?
I’ve grown tired of hearing that name.

31
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,500
If you’re tired of it, 
then what shall I call you?

32
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,000
We are called "Sensus!"

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
With this Holy Sword Durandal,
I shall carve this name upon your body

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,699
So you may never forget!

35
00:02:48,699 --> 00:02:53,000
Interesting! 
I’d like to see you try!

36
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:21,000
Not yet... I’m not dead yet...

37
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Without me to gather Terran souls,
Cielo will...

38
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,500
Our ideal... once Cielo’s united with Terro,
your worries will be meaningless.

39
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:36,000
Rest yourself and witness this world’s future!

40
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
...So be it.

41
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,300
From the day, I reincarnate once again...

42
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:44,500
I shall judge the consequences 
of your deeds myself!

43
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,000
Behold! Hypnos of Ratio has fallen!

44
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,199
Forward, Sensus!

45
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:57,300
From this point on, Ciella Castello is ours!

46
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:00,000
Our ideals will be fulfilled,

47
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And the Genesis will be ours!

48
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,199
And soon... soon...

49
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:11,000
The Primordial Giant’s Wish...
and our goal...

50
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
As long as I obtain it... yes...
as long as I have it...
