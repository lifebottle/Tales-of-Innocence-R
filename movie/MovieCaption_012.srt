00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:14,000
How pitiful. It's most likely that the Church and the Army both...

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
...have lost sight of what they were fighting for in the first place.

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Look, it's obvious that the Imperial Army
overpowers the Church by a long shot

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
They'd win in no time.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
No, look over there.
The Church has something in store.
