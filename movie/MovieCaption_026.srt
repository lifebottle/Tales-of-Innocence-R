00:00:07,199 --> 00:00:09,800
The cause of Cielo's destruction...

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,800
...and the one who brought misfortune
upon everyone was me...

3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,000
I... I...

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,500
It's better if I just disappear!

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,000
It'd be better!!

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,500
Lady Mattheus, the castle is collapsing.

7
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,500
There is still time. Come, Chitose!

8
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:39,000
Everyone, let's hurry back to the airship.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
But Ruca...!

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,500
We can't leave him here!

11
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,700
............Can't be helped.

12
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,000
Oi, Kongwai, QQ.

13
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:53,799
You bastar...

14
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:57,700
Sorry, but we can't afford to lose you two here.

15
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,500
Ange, Hermie, let's go!

16
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,000
Do you think Ruca would want you to stay here?
